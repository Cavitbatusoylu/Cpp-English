# 💻 My C++ Study Notes and Code Examples  
Hello! 👋 This repository contains the example codes I wrote throughout the **Udemy** C++ fundamental course. Since C++ is the **first programming language** I started with, this project is more than just a technical milestone — it represents a **personal turning point** for me. ✨  

## 📚 About This Repository  
This repo includes practical code examples covering the foundational building blocks of the C++ language. The code comments are provided in both **Turkish** and **English**, making it a useful bilingual resource for learners worldwide. 🌍  

## 🔧 Covered Topics  
- ✅ Variables and Data Types  
- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- ✅ Functions and Parameters  
- ✅ Arrays and String Operations  
- ✅ Pointers and Memory Management  
- ✅ Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- ✅ Encapsulation, Inheritance, Constructor/Destructor  

## 🧠 What Is My Goal?  
This repo is not just an output of a course; it’s the **first step towards a solid entry into the C++ world**. I’m continuously improving and planning to add more projects and advanced topics on top of this foundation. 🚀
